# Integration and Connector Examples

## Adobe Campaign on Platform

With segments defined through Segment Builder, the next step is to take action on those segments. Now the segments are handed off to the Marketer ("Teresa") so that she can utilize Adobe Campaign on Platform to direct a marketing campaign to these segments. Since we are handing it off to the Marketing team, we will demonstrate this part of the process through the following video demo:

## Adobe Launch with Experience Platform integration

In addition to external connectors, all Adobe Experience Cloud solutions will have connectors into the Experience Platform. Some products can help build data into our customer loyalty program by streaming data, both customer and behavioral, and using that to further enrich the existing Unified Profiles (or help to create new ones). One example of this is Adobe Launch, which can facilitate automated streaming of web interaction data (forms, page behavior) into Experience Platform through Launch and Experience Platform APIs, which can help to build faster profile creation and updates for customers, such immediately seeing points earned from a transaction in a customer's loyalty account. The following video demonstrates the power of Launch:
