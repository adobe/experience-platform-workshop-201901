# New Layout for AEP Workshop Content

### Content Needs

Need to split up the content between UI and API, as the first half of Partner summit will be run through just the UI as a walk-along demo, and is catered to a broader audience. The session after that will cover the API, and will be for those technical enough to want to continue using it.

1. [x] \(Ryan) Content for UI walkthroughs needs to be updated for additional steps, changes in the old UI, and adding in a Launch streaming option
1. [ ] \(Simon / Ryan) API section needs the following changes:
   - [x] \(Simon) Remove the portions that take significant waiting time from parallel user processing: segment job posting, segment dataset creation
   - [x] \(Simon) Add additional content to use Query Service
   - [x] \(Simon) Include single-page local server setup for Launch endpoint streaming
   - [x] \(Ryan) Walkthrough creating streaming endpoint / data through Launch API and observing on new page
1. [ ] \(Ryan) Find a way to preview analytics data - either populate with existing Analytics data into new org (can we do this?) or do a visual walkthrough on-stage (not letting user interact)
1. [x] \(Ryan) Gather correct datafiles to use (Look @ TtT Use-Case 1 and 4)

### Logistical Needs

1. [x] \(Ryan) Provision 2 orgs to use (UI and API)
1. [x] \(Simon) Build local-server page to use for Launch streaming
1. [ ] \(Simon) Create master admin account to give to users to do their own provisioning
1. [ ] \(Simon) Set up Adobe.com accounts for non-Adobe users
1. [x] \(Simon) Host repo on external Adobe Github
